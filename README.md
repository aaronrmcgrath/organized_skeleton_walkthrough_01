To run project, fork or download the project zip. You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
installed. Once installed using the command line/terminal navigate to the main project folder and enter `npm install`
to install all dependencies. To run, enter the command `npm start` and in a browser head over to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
Now you have a base root directory for and Angular 1 project.
